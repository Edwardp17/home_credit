Considerations & Notes:

- Would be nice to be able to use like 4000 n_estimators; model runs for too long if I try that. So we are at 100.

- feature selection (keep 95% variance) or maybe PCA???

- lightgbm (its a microsoft thing so its a hassle to implement on macos)

- k fold cross validation?

- merging tables (this goes along with EDA)

some ideas:
its not quite clear what these two people are doing for null values in their code, other than that it has some ideas
